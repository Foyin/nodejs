I've put together a solution for tutorial 9. I think that the first two tasks are very reasonable but the third one is likely to be difficult for the students. I anticipate that the use of two data sets will stump some people and they may end up trying to somehow consolidate the data into a single data set. Overall I don't think that will be too problematic though, it is the sorting by frequency in the different data sets that I think will cause the most problems. While it's nothing that they can't figure out given the material that you've taught them, I think the combination of the data strucutres and the functions and methods needed to manipulate them here is going to cause a lot of confusion. Maybe my expectations are too low but I think that not many will complete this part.

Also, a few parts of the instructions I think could do with some clarification:

"What files are loaded into the browser when the application is started?"
to
"What files are loaded into the browser when the a request for / is made?"

"How do we get the value of the numerical range?"
to
"How do we get the value of the numerical range (word frequency)?"

This one is an actual typo:
"When "Yes" is selected, all of the words should be converted to lower case and then analyzed."
to
"When "No" is selected, all of the words should be converted to lower case and then analyzed."
